Wingert&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the great challenges of science is to facilitate the construction and availability of knowledge. In the digital age, knowledge about biodiversity is found mainly in scientific publications, which can be uploaded to various repositories or databases. To provide information to these repositories, data must be transformed into machine-readable formats. Additionally, people need to be trained and equipped to access and use this data appropriately. Colombia is a country with great biodiversity and important research institutions that constantly produce scientific knowledge such as Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNC), Universidad del Rosario, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Universidad La Salle, Universidad de Los Andes, Universidad Jorge Tadeo, and Instituto Humboldt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BiodiversityPMC: The One Health Library (Poster)</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2024/04/biodiversitypmc-the-one-health-library/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 12:48:04 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://plazi.org/posts/2024/04/biodiversitypmc-the-one-health-library/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; all day&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Presenters:&lt;/strong&gt; Emilie Pasche, Julien Gobeill, Donat Agosti, Lyubomir Penev, Quentin Groom, Teodor Georgiev, Esteban Gaillac, Alexandre Flament, Déborah Caucheteur, Pierre-André Michel, Marie Kolsch, Anaïs Mottaz, Patrick Ruch&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One Health is a comprehensive and unified approach that recognises the close connection between the health of people, animals and whole ecosystems. While life and health sciences are widely represented in digital libraries such as PubMed Central, articles focussing on biodiversity, ecology or environmental sciences are relatively marginal. Addressing this critical gap, we introduce a novel Research Infrastructure named “BiodiversityPMC”, leveraging the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Literature Services (SIBiLS), which are already mirroring MEDLINE (over 36 million abstracts), PubMed Central contents (over 6 million full-text articles) and supplementary data files associated to scientific publications (over 6 million supplementary files including OCRized images and tables). The coverage of SIBiLS is expanded to encompass a broader range of biodiversity-related content, including environmental sciences and ecology. This involves indexing half a million taxonomic treatments and articles harvested from Plazi, and a growing set of full-text articles from journals in the field (e.g., Pensoft, European Journal of Taxonomy), which are not included into the original PubMed Central. To ensure comprehensive and standardized access, the contents are normalized using a large collection of life sciences terminologies and ontologies. Each instance of a term (or its synonym) is assigned a unique accession number, to support a semantically richer search experience. Of particular interest for the biodiversity communities, SIBiLS contents are normalized using ENVO (Environmental Ontology), ROBI (Relation Ontology Biotic Interactions), an enriched subset of RO (Relation Ontology), and LOTUS, a natural products database. Further, taxonomic names are normalized using both the NCBI Taxonomy and the Open Tree of Life, which include names from the Catalogue of Life. The resulting data graph contains more than 10 billion normalized descriptors. Access to BiodiversityPMC is facilitated through a &lt;a href=&#34;https://sibils.text-analytics.ch/search/&#34;&gt;new graphic user interface&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sibils.text-analytics.ch/api/&#34;&gt;an OpenAPI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sibils.text-analytics.ch/sparql/&#34;&gt;a SPARQL endpoint&lt;/a&gt;. BiodiversityPMC not only offers traditional search methods (access via keyword search), but also introduces innovative approaches for navigating the complex landscape of health and environmental sciences. An original question-answering interface can help provide new perspectives over the literature. BidoversityPMC stands out as a valuable resource proficient in addressing a wide spectrum of questions related to biodiversity in the broad sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How do we get there? a 7* scheme of getting open FAIR publications</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2024/04/a-7-scheme-for-getting-fair-publications/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 12:48:04 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://plazi.org/posts/2024/04/a-7-scheme-for-getting-fair-publications/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 2:30PM CEST&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Presenters:&lt;/strong&gt; Donat Agosti&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research results are published as scientific articles. They represent an intricate network of citations and facts, representing the existing knowledge, as billions of statements. In biodiversity, this includes a corpus of an estimated 500 million pages. A small but growing part is published in a semantically enhanced open access format, but the overwhelming part is behind multiple barriers, from being print only to closed access portable document formats (PDFs). To make use of the emerging AI tools, this corpus needs to be made available in a machine actionable way. At least part of it has to be curated to serve as training material for AI and machine learning. The steps towards fully machine actionable data will be described in this presentation. Starting with print (), print with metadata (), to scan-based PDF with metadata (), text-based PDF with metadata (), ASCI – standard structured XML with metadata (), ASCI – XML with semantic enhancements and metadata () and ending with ASCI – XML with semantic enhancements, attributes and metadata (****). To serve the wider community, the publications have to be open access, infrastructures need to be expanded such as the Biodiversity Literature Repository to allow FAIRizing of data, including specific blocks of text such as taxonomic treatments, recommendations or illustrations, and vocabularies have to be developed and maintained to enable semantic enhancement in cases where they do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TreatmentBank: an automated workflow to convert biodiversity PDFs as input into Biodiversity PMC</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presenter:&lt;/strong&gt; Donat Agosti&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several ELIXIR communities are designing text analytic solutions to perform various data curation tasks. The development of pre-trained and large language models is also helping non expert communities developing successful applications (e.g., triage, named-entity recognition, chatbots, search engines). The span of tasks can be relatively heterogeneous, ranging from well-established and common natural language processing tasks (e.g., named entity recognition, automatic text categorization) up to more complex curation support tasks (e.g., triage or question-answering, bi-directional linking between curated databases and publications). There is also a growing focus on converting and annotating publications, to expand the pool of FAIR data available for downstream tasks, as illustrated by the efforts of the Elixir Data Platform and several node and ELIXIR core data resources (e.g., BioStudies, EuropePMC).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Engaging the community in FAIR taxonomic data liberation: an overview of training resources at Plazi</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/engaging-the-community-in-fair-data-liberation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presenter:&lt;/strong&gt; Julia Giora&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, swiss-based not-for-profit organization Plazi has been supporting and promoting the development of persistent and openly accessible digital taxonomic literature. To achieve this goal, Plazi makes use of in-house softwares for data mining and extraction from taxonomic publications, along with other partner institution tools and platforms, to liberate data on animals, plants, fungi, and more. In its mission to make taxonomic data FAIRly available to the community, Plazi has developed sets of training material and courses, which enables taxonomists, collection curators, students, technicians and others to participate in the process of taxonomic data liberation. The participation of several different members of the community is key as data requires deep curation, often very specific to a particular field. Most recently, Plazi led a virtual 2-day workshop as part of the MOBILISE ACTION in Europe, along with two 4-day in-person workshops in Brazil and South Africa. Participants are issued certificates which entitle them to extract data on their own, thus multiplying the output of FAIR data using Plazi’s workflow. Here, we present a summary of the current status of said training tools/material, the next steps in development, and how they can help more and more taxonomists, or enthusiasts, liberate data. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sEbOYL44gCSlENWCofvvx7f2hrSWsLHO/view?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Matching material citations to occurrences: extending the biodiversity knowledge graph</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/matching-material-citations-to-occurrences/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 17:34:04 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/matching-material-citations-to-occurrences/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presenter:&lt;/strong&gt; Donat Agosti&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scholarly publications are the channel to communicate research findings based on the analysis of specimens and their traits. In an open science world, the link to the specimens together with the description of the methods involved should enable us to reproduce the results. Increasingly, taxonomic publications provide a section with structured or even semantically enhanced tables, including persistent digital identifiers of the specimens. These publications can be processed, reformatted as datasets of material citations that can be reused, for example by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). In many cases these are the only representations of species in GBIF, but in other cases they complement specimens that have been submitted as preserved specimens. In this case, the presence of a material citation provides in return access to the knowledge about the specimen, or in other words, extends the biodiversity knowledge graph from a specimen to what is stated in the respective hosting taxonomic treatment, often far beyond by all the links that are embedded in it. Matching can be done automatically but in many cases depends on human curation. For this case a matching service developed with the Swiss eBioDiv and the European funded BiCIKL projects will be explained.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Text Mining and Biodiversity Research Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/text-mining-and-biodiv-ri/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 17:34:04 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/text-mining-and-biodiv-ri/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The scientific knowledge on biodiversity is imprisoned in a daily growing corpus of hundred millions of pages of scientific publications. This knowledge is needed to better understand the dynamics and dimensions of the global biodiversity crisis, to understand the impact of climate change on the distribution of species or to understand the viral spillover from animals to humans. This knowledge is very difficult to access because it is unstructured, in printed formats, including portable data format (PDF), which are difficult to machine operate, or closed access. The power of access to millions of machine actionable articles in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc&#34;&gt;PMC&lt;/a&gt;, including millions of supplementary data files, or tens of millions of abstracts in PubMed and tools to annotate and mine and discover new facts is obvious. These tools could be used for TDM and annotations of biodiversity literature - but the PMC/PubMed equivalent has not been available for publications in the biodiversity domain, hence the need for a BiodiversityPMC!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The new value of scientific publications in the digital age</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/new-value-of-scientific-pubs/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 17:34:04 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/new-value-of-scientific-pubs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientific publications are the means by which scientific knowledge is communicated. In botany as well as all biological sciences, each new species discovered is based on at least one publication including a protologue conformant to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. A protologue is based on a standard vocabulary, including a material citation of the type specimen and its hosting institution, generally a figure with the diagnostic characters and a discussion of related species. Increasingly, DNA sequences are cited. The protologues are referenced in subsequent taxonomic treatments, clearly delimited sections of a publications about one particular taxon, and implicit in taxonomic names. Together, these treatments cover the history of the names of the taxon (synonymy), are a very rich source for traits, distribution, and since they are based on physical specimens, an authoritative identification of these specimens. It is assumed that the corpus of biodiversity literature includes a daily growing corpus of 500 million pages, housed in the many libraries of natural history institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Publishing: Extending the biodiversity knowledge graph</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/extending-the-biodiv-knowledge-graph/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 17:34:04 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/extending-the-biodiv-knowledge-graph/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A goal of natural history institutions is contributing to the understanding of biodiversity and disseminating this knowledge by becoming scientific publishers. Through this, they joined the growing field of scholarly publishing established in 1665 by the Journal des sçavans to publish work from the sciences. One of the characteristics of scientific publishing is to cite previous works and thus linking existing knowledge with new discoveries. To provide access to the growing corpus of publications, libraries began to index individual works. With the advent of the digital age, full text search and text and data mining provide access to the content using machines analysing large corpora of works. The development of the semantic web enabled creating a knowledge graph. A typical example is the growth of knowledge related to a species, including synonyms, cited specimens, figures or DNA sequences. During this symposium the state and recent developments of biodiversity publishing, linking and providing increased access to data by &lt;a href=&#34;https://pensoft.net/&#34;&gt;Pensoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cetaf.org/&#34;&gt;CETAF&lt;/a&gt;-publishing group, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mnhn.fr/en&#34;&gt;MNHN Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://plazi.org/&#34;&gt;Plazi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sib.swiss/&#34;&gt;Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt;, including over 50 journals in a semantic enhanced format, and supported by a series of projects (&lt;a href=&#34;https://bicikl-project.eu/&#34;&gt;BiCIKL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ebiodiv.org/&#34;&gt;eBioDiv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Arcadia fund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/metostem-2/&#34;&gt;MétoSTeM&lt;/a&gt;) will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/toolbox-to-link-biodiv-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We will demonstrate tools and infrastructure from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bicikl-project.eu/&#34;&gt;BiCIKL&lt;/a&gt; project to find and establish links between entities. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure to create and manage machine actionable persistent identifiers (PIDs) for digital specimens. This allows the creation and annotation of digital specimens as new actionable objects on the internet, which provide a surrogate for physical specimens.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://openbiodiv.net/&#34;&gt;OpenBiodiv&lt;/a&gt; is a linked open data (LOD) knowledge graph extracted from the biodiversity literature. OpenBiodiv can discover hidden links, e.g., between authors, taxa, sequences, material citations, publications and others using general search, SPARQL (query language), user applications and API.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://plazi.org/treatmentbank/&#34;&gt;TreatmentBank&lt;/a&gt; liberates data from within publications, and converts, enhances, links, stores, and disseminates it as findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data. The API has been enhanced allowing better data linkages through identifiers, matching services, and avenues for annotation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.expasy.org/resources/sibils&#34;&gt;SIBiLS&lt;/a&gt; custom search services provide access to biomedical literature, including PubMed Central (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/&#34;&gt;PMC&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/index.html&#34;&gt;MEDLINE&lt;/a&gt;. It also provides access to half a million taxonomic treatments curated by &lt;a href=&#34;https://plazi.org/&#34;&gt;Plazi&lt;/a&gt;. BICIKL has helped aggregate more publications, enabling the creation of an all-inclusive “One Health” library, the BiodiversityPMC.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.checklistbank.org/&#34;&gt;ChecklistBank&lt;/a&gt; is an open data repository with a focus on taxonomy and nomenclature. It has tools for name matching, dataset comparison, and for linking taxonomic names from literature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ebiodiv.org/&#34;&gt;eBioDiv&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/topics/digitalisation/open-science/programme&#34;&gt;Swissuniversities&lt;/a&gt; funded project by a consortium of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hes-so.ch/en/homepage&#34;&gt;HES-SO&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sib.swiss/&#34;&gt;SIB&lt;/a&gt; (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), Plazi, and the Natural History Museum of Bern (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nmbe.ch/de&#34;&gt;NMBE&lt;/a&gt;) with the goal to build a knowledge infrastructure to bring data in taxonomic literature together with physical specimens digitalized through projects funded by &lt;a href=&#34;https://swisscollnet.scnat.ch/de&#34;&gt;SwissCollNet&lt;/a&gt;. The linking is based on that fact that specimen, the basis of taxonomic works, are cited formally in the publications as material citations. They can be made &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/&#34;&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; (Findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable). The eBioDiv &lt;a href=&#34;http://plazi.org/posts/2023/02/expanding-the-biodiv-knowledge-graph/&#34;&gt;matching service&lt;/a&gt; allows to discover the cited specimen, especially if the natural history institution uploaded them to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/&#34;&gt;GBIF&lt;/a&gt;. The link furthermore allows to follow-up from a specimen to what is known about it in the published literature. The complementing Horizon Europe funded project Biodiversity Community Integrated Knowledge Library &lt;a href=&#34;https://bicikl-project.eu/&#34;&gt;BiCIKL&lt;/a&gt; allows further linking of a specimen to taxonomic names or gene sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Though we are far from knowning how many species there are on planet Earth, we keep track of their descriptions and number through the information kept in our libraries. Each species discovered is represented therein by at least one taxononic treatment. The library includes an estimated 500 million pages and is updated daily with an estimated 17–18,000 new species annually and over 100,000 treatments augmenting the knowledge of existing species. &lt;a href=&#34;https://biss.pensoft.net/article/91167/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Taxonomic Treatments as Open FAIR Digital Objects</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2022/08/fair-digital-objects/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taxonomy is the science of charting and describing the worlds biodiversity. Organisms are grouped into taxa which are given a given rank building the taxonomic hierarchy. The taxa are described in taxonomic treatments, well defined sections of scientific publications (Catapano 2019). They include a nomenclatural section and one or more sections including descriptions, material citations referring to studied specimens, or notes ecology and behavior. In case the treatment does not describe a new discovered taxon, previous treatments are cited in the form of treatment citations. This citation can refer to a previous treatment and add additional data, or it can be a statement synonymizing the taxon with another taxon. This allows building a citation network, and ultimately is a constituent part of the catalogue of life. Thus treatments play an important role to understand the diversity of life on Earth by providing the scientific argument why group of organism is a new species, or a synonym, and the data provided will increasingly be important to analyze and compare whole genomes of individual genomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Divisive Power of Citizenship, one of our Institute’s SNSF-funded project, concludes this year with its closing international conference on 22/23 September 2022 in Basel, Switzerland. This event will offer a broad platform for debate about citizenship in a global context, addressing scholars working in the fields of Global History, Asian Studies, International Law and Digital Humanities, at a time of terrifying topicality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The central themes of discussion will be expat communities in Asia, and civil internment camps during the Second World War in Asia, which have been rarely studied until now. An additional methodological component will investigate the potential of digital methods in this field, which will analyse the impact of access to precise data at scale relating to networks of foreign residents—addressing interferences with citizenship, statelessness and denaturalisation. The conference will also form the launch for new data resources which have been created during the course of the project, covering Foreign Residents in East Asia between 1863 and 1941.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>400 Years of Botanical Collections – Implications for Present-Day Research</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2022/08/400-years-of-botanical-collections/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bauhin’s pioneering Flora of Basel „Catalogus Plantarum circa Basileam sponte nascentium“ exactly 400 years ago is a precursor to the artificially identified beginning of taxonomic publishing with Linnaeus Systema plantarum … 1753. Indeed, botanical publishing existed far before Linnaeus’, however his contribution has not only been the Latin Binomen, but the highly structured way he published the taxonomic treatments for each species, and to cite previous works. In the digital age, this kind of structuring of the information and the existing implicit citation links allows building the biodiversity knowledge graph, opening up the entire corpus of taxonomic treatments imprisoned in publications by providing it in a format that can be found and reused, cited and linked to data referenced in the publications. This provides access to all the published data about a specimen in a natural history collection, to trace back the history of a taxonomic name or the traits used to describe and deliminit the species. The Swiss based Biodiversity Literature Repository and TreatmentBank provide access to over 750,000 taxonomic treatments, over 1M material citations and are the largest data set provider to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). This highly automated workflow has and continues to liberate data from over 70,000 publications, which are further converted to RDF and structured into Linked Open Data via the OpenBiodiv Biodiversity Knowledge Graph. At the same time new ways to structure publications so that their resident data can immediately be reused upon publication are being developed in collaboration with Pensoft publishers, the Muséum d’histoire naturelle, Paris and the CETAF publishing group. The Swiss NGO Plazi, Zenodo at CERN and SIBiLS at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics are involved in the EU Horizon 2020 project BiCIKL and the Swissuniversities funded project eBioDiv to develop ways to link data in publications to specimens, taxonomic names and genes and vice versa. This lecture will explain the concept and state of the art in taxonomic publishing, access and reuse of its data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What do we not know – quantifying data gaps and biases in knowledge of bat co-roosting</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2022/08/what-we-dont-know/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 13:48:04 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Improved understanding of co-habitation of roosts by multiple species of bats is essential for estimating the risks of zoonotic disease transmission. However, ecological data on roosting environments, species richness, bat-bat interactions, viral infections, and other species interactions are scattered throughout the literature, making them difficult to study on a global scale. The research scope for most roost studies has been narrow, focusing on roost type, bat abundance, and locality data while failing to investigate interspecific roosting interactions. To meet this need, we have collaboratively built an open-access dataset of ecological interactions (including co-roosting, trophic, anthropogenic, and parasitic) extracted from the literature to improve our understanding of roost dynamics on a global scale, and to elucidate the role of shared roosts in disease transmission. As of April 2022, &amp;gt; 11,500 interaction records involving &amp;gt; 360 bat species from &amp;gt; 137 countries encompassing a variety of habitats have been extracted from &amp;gt; 175 publications spanning from 1860-2020, all accessible via the Coronavirus-Host community at Zenodo. With this benchmark dataset of open-access digitized interaction data, tools, and workflows, we provide evidence of co-roosting events that we aligned with multiple ontologies (interaction terms, taxonomies, administrative regions) and phylogenies suitable for high-throughput analysis We followed open access and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles for extracting data and choosing methodologies. We identify biases in the coverage of bat interaction records, suggest new tools for biodiversity informatics, and explore obstacles and opportunities in the mining of eco-interactions previously lost in the annals of scientific literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Biodiversity Literature Repository — Open By Design</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2022/05/blr-open-by-design/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Open Definition version 2.1 prescribes four conditions for openness of a work &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it must be published under an open license or be in the public domain,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it must be accessible easily and at no more than the cost of reproduction, preferably be downloadable via the internet&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it must be readily readable by a computer, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it must be available in an open format.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that openness is not just a matter of sticking an open license. Openness has to be a fundamental goal and part of the design. This becomes all the more important for complicated endeavors such as scientific data that need to exist in a stable form far into the future (&amp;ldquo;forever&amp;rdquo;). At Plazi we have been extracting data from biodiversity literature and making it FAIR and open for more than a decade. To do this, we have built (or helped build) the tools, the procedures, the repositories, the standards, and the partnerships to extract, clean, archive and disseminate data for perpetuity. &lt;a href=&#34;https://punkish.org/Biodiversity-Literature-Repository/&#34;&gt;In this presentation&lt;/a&gt; we will share our experience building a lasting research infrastructure that is open by design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is an amount of information that can not be processed by humans, but even machines can’t cope with it because the publications are either not scanned, or are behind paywalls, or in formats that machines can’t read at scale. It is a tragedy that in this digital age we can’t make use of this data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nothing in (taxonomic) publishing makes sense</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Donat Agosti will provide the lecture &lt;em&gt;Nothing in (taxonomic) publishing makes sense except in the light of treatments&lt;/em&gt; at the conference of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://spnhc2022.com/about/&#34;&gt;Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal of taxonomic literature is to describe taxonomic diversity as a result of charting the Earth&amp;rsquo;s biological diversity. As research adds to our knowledge, our understanding of taxa increases with additional published results. This is how it has happened since the standard publications by Linnaeus in 1753 and 1758 in the format of taxonomic treatments, clearly delimited sections of text about a particular taxon. Later, material citations were added, providing an explicit link to the material that led to the published research result. Each treatment has a nomenclatural section including the referenced taxonomic name representing the usage of a specific citable name. Thus, the taxonomic name Apis mellifera L, 1758 refers to the taxonomic treatment published by Linnaeus 1758 on page 576. Later usage of the name cites this treatment thereby adding new research to the scientific corpus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We report progress towards automatically transforming existing analyses of scientific literature into annotations based on W3C&amp;rsquo;s Web Annotation Data Model (WADM). Case studies are presented from the life sciences, and social sciences and humanities, in which these developments have led to the creation of new unrestricted data services for the research community. We discuss the cross- domain potential of annotation infrastructure for releasing scientific facts reported in research literature from copyright restrictions, and demonstrate the utility of common standards-based preservation and discovery methods in disparate activities. We suggest that scientific treatments of literature using WADM annotation can lead to new mechanisms for access to and reuse of research data, and accelerate convergence with the FAIR Principles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
