      <description>Plazi will participate in the Biohackthon Europe. Each November ELIXIR organizes BioHackathon Europe, which brings together bioinformaticians from around the world. The event takes place in different locations around Europe. The BioHackathon offers an intense week of hacking, with over 160 international participants who work on diverse and exciting projects. The week starts with a half-day symposium to introduce these projects, and is followed by five days of hacking with one sole aim: coding to address problems in bioinformatics.</description>

Abstract: We report progress towards automatically transforming existing analyses of scientific literature into annotations based on W3C&amp;rsquo;s Web Annotation Data Model (WADM). Case studies are presented from the life sciences, and social sciences and humanities, in which these developments have led to the creation of new unrestricted data services for the research community.</description>

      <description>Plazi will present its groundbreaking approach to the &amp;ldquo;liberation&amp;rdquo; of data from taxonomic treatments within scholarly publications at the World Biodiversity Forum.
Reliable and accessible data is essential for understanding biodiversity, its status, trends and pressures, and thus responding with informed policies and action. The FAIR data management principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable, are increasingly referenced and required by funding agencies and institutions; however, implementation remains deficient at many levels.</description>
