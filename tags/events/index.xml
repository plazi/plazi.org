      <description>Presenter: Julia Giora
Since 2008, swiss-based not-for-profit organization Plazi has been supporting and promoting the development of persistent and openly accessible digital taxonomic literature. To achieve this goal, Plazi makes use of in-house softwares for data mining and extraction from taxonomic publications, along with other partner institution tools and platforms, to liberate data on animals, plants, fungi, and more. In its mission to make taxonomic data FAIRly available to the community, Plazi has developed sets of training material and courses, which enables taxonomists, collection curators, students, technicians and others to participate in the process of taxonomic data liberation.</description>

      <description>Presenter: Donat Agosti
Scholarly publications are the channel to communicate research findings based on the analysis of specimens and their traits. In an open science world, the link to the specimens together with the description of the methods involved should enable us to reproduce the results. Increasingly, taxonomic publications provide a section with structured or even semantically enhanced tables, including persistent digital identifiers of the specimens. These publications can be processed, reformatted as datasets of material citations that can be reused, for example by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).</description>

      <description>The scientific knowledge on biodiversity is imprisoned in a daily growing corpus of hundred millions of pages of scientific publications. This knowledge is needed to better understand the dynamics and dimensions of the global biodiversity crisis, to understand the impact of climate change on the distribution of species or to understand the viral spillover from animals to humans. This knowledge is very difficult to access because it is unstructured, in printed formats, including portable data format (PDF), which are difficult to machine operate, or closed access.</description>

      <title>The new value of scientific publications in the digital age</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/new-value-of-scientific-pubs/</link>

      <guid>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/new-value-of-scientific-pubs/</guid>
      <description>Scientific publications are the means by which scientific knowledge is communicated. In botany as well as all biological sciences, each new species discovered is based on at least one publication including a protologue conformant to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. A protologue is based on a standard vocabulary, including a material citation of the type specimen and its hosting institution, generally a figure with the diagnostic characters and a discussion of related species.</description>

      <description>A goal of natural history institutions is contributing to the understanding of biodiversity and disseminating this knowledge by becoming scientific publishers. Through this, they joined the growing field of scholarly publishing established in 1665 by the Journal des sçavans to publish work from the sciences. One of the characteristics of scientific publishing is to cite previous works and thus linking existing knowledge with new discoveries. To provide access to the growing corpus of publications, libraries began to index individual works.</description>

      <description>eBioDiv is a Swissuniversities funded project by a consortium of HES-SO/SIB (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), Plazi, and the Natural History Museum of Bern (NMBE) with the goal to build a knowledge infrastructure to bring data in taxonomic literature together with physical specimens digitalized through projects funded by SwissCollNet. The linking is based on that fact that specimen, the basis of taxonomic works, are cited formally in the publications as material citations.</description>

      <description>Enabling Published Taxonomic Data to Address the Biodiversity Crisis The use-case of Biodiversity Literature Repository and TreatmentBank
Date and Time: Oct 17, 2022, 2:00 PM
Abstract: To understand the loss of species, a benchmark is needed, e.g. the status of biodiversity in 1992 when the Convention on Biological Diversity recognized biodiversity crisis to compare to its status in the successive year. Though we are far from knowning how many species there are on planet Earth, we keep track of their descriptions and number through the information kept in our libraries.</description>

      <description>Abstract
Taxonomy is the science of charting and describing the worlds biodiversity. Organisms are grouped into taxa which are given a given rank building the taxonomic hierarchy. The taxa are described in taxonomic treatments, well defined sections of scientific publications (Catapano 2019). They include a nomenclatural section and one or more sections including descriptions, material citations referring to studied specimens, or notes ecology and behavior. In case the treatment does not describe a new discovered taxon, previous treatments are cited in the form of treatment citations.</description>

      <description>Abstract
Divisive Power of Citizenship, one of our Institute’s SNSF-funded project, concludes this year with its closing international conference on 22/23 September 2022 in Basel, Switzerland. This event will offer a broad platform for debate about citizenship in a global context, addressing scholars working in the fields of Global History, Asian Studies, International Law and Digital Humanities, at a time of terrifying topicality.
The central themes of discussion will be expat communities in Asia, and civil internment camps during the Second World War in Asia, which have been rarely studied until now.</description>

      <title>400 Years of Botanical Collections – Implications for Present-Day Research</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2022/08/400-years-of-botanical-collections/</link>

      <description>Abstract
Bauhin’s pioneering Flora of Basel „Catalogus Plantarum circa Basileam sponte nascentium“ exactly 400 years ago is a precursor to the artificially identified beginning of taxonomic publishing with Linnaeus Systema plantarum … 1753. Indeed, botanical publishing existed far before Linnaeus’, however his contribution has not only been the Latin Binomen, but the highly structured way he published the taxonomic treatments for each species, and to cite previous works. In the digital age, this kind of structuring of the information and the existing implicit citation links allows building the biodiversity knowledge graph, opening up the entire corpus of taxonomic treatments imprisoned in publications by providing it in a format that can be found and reused, cited and linked to data referenced in the publications.</description>

      <description>Improved understanding of co-habitation of roosts by multiple species of bats is essential for estimating the risks of zoonotic disease transmission. However, ecological data on roosting environments, species richness, bat-bat interactions, viral infections, and other species interactions are scattered throughout the literature, making them difficult to study on a global scale. The research scope for most roost studies has been narrow, focusing on roost type, bat abundance, and locality data while failing to investigate interspecific roosting interactions.</description>

      <description>The Open Definition version 2.1 prescribes four conditions for openness of a work &amp;ndash;
it must be published under an open license or be in the public domain, it must be accessible easily and at no more than the cost of reproduction, preferably be downloadable via the internet it must be readily readable by a computer, and it must be available in an open format. It is clear that openness is not just a matter of sticking an open license.</description>

      <description>Donat Agosti will provide the lecture Nothing in (taxonomic) publishing makes sense except in the light of treatments at the conference of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC).
The goal of taxonomic literature is to describe taxonomic diversity as a result of charting the Earth&amp;rsquo;s biological diversity. As research adds to our knowledge, our understanding of taxa increases with additional published results. This is how it has happened since the standard publications by Linnaeus in 1753 and 1758 in the format of taxonomic treatments, clearly delimited sections of text about a particular taxon.</description>

      <description>We report progress towards automatically transforming existing analyses of scientific literature into annotations based on W3C&amp;rsquo;s Web Annotation Data Model (WADM). Case studies are presented from the life sciences, and social sciences and humanities, in which these developments have led to the creation of new unrestricted data services for the research community. We discuss the cross- domain potential of annotation infrastructure for releasing scientific facts reported in research literature from copyright restrictions, and demonstrate the utility of common standards-based preservation and discovery methods in disparate activities.</description>
