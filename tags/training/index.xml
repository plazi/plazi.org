      <description>eBioDiv is a Swissuniversities funded project by a consortium of HES-SO/SIB (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), Plazi, and the Natural History Museum of Bern (NMBE) with the goal to build a knowledge infrastructure to bring data in taxonomic literature together with physical specimens digitalized through projects funded by SwissCollNet. The linking is based on that fact that specimen, the basis of taxonomic works, are cited formally in the publications as material citations.</description>

Plazi’s first online two day training course “Biodiversity and Digital Media: linking material citations in publications to specimens” organized by Julia Giora and Jonas Castro has successfully ended. The Training school happened online from the 27th to the 28th of February 2023.
