      <description>A goal of natural history institutions is contributing to the understanding of biodiversity and disseminating this knowledge by becoming scientific publishers. Through this, they joined the growing field of scholarly publishing established in 1665 by the Journal des s√ßavans to publish work from the sciences. One of the characteristics of scientific publishing is to cite previous works and thus linking existing knowledge with new discoveries. To provide access to the growing corpus of publications, libraries began to index individual works.</description>

      <title>The BiCIKL toolbox to link biodiversity data</title>

      <description>We will demonstrate tools and infrastructure from the BiCIKL project to find and establish links between entities. These include:&#xA;Infrastructure to create and manage machine actionable persistent identifiers (PIDs) for digital specimens. This allows the creation and annotation of digital specimens as new actionable objects on the internet, which provide a surrogate for physical specimens. OpenBiodiv is a linked open data (LOD) knowledge graph extracted from the biodiversity literature. OpenBiodiv can discover hidden links, e.</description>

      <title>eBioDiv: linking specimens with literature, or to what is known about a specimen</title>

      <description>eBioDiv is a Swissuniversities funded project by a consortium of HES-SO/SIB (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), Plazi, and the Natural History Museum of Bern (NMBE) with the goal to build a knowledge infrastructure to bring data in taxonomic literature together with physical specimens digitalized through projects funded by SwissCollNet. The linking is based on that fact that specimen, the basis of taxonomic works, are cited formally in the publications as material citations.</description>
