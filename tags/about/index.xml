      <description>Plazi&amp;rsquo;s Goal Plazi supports and promotes the development of persistent and openly accessible digital taxonomic literature. To this end Plazi:
 Maintains a digital taxonomic literature repository to enable archiving of taxonomic treatments. Enhances submitted taxonomic treatments by creating TaxonX and Taxpub XML versions. Participates in the development of new models for publishing taxonomic treatments in order to maximize interoperability with relevant cyberinfrastructure components (e.g., name servers, biodiversity resources, etc…) Advocates and educates about the vital importance of maintaining free and open access to scientific discourse and data  Plazi is a not-for-profit organization based in Bern, Switzerland and was founded on March 13th 2008.</description>

      <description>Zenodo Zenodo, Plazi and Pensoft collaborate in developing the Biodiversity Literature Repository as an open access repository to articles and liberated open FAIR data including figures and taxonomic treatments related to biodiversity. A customized access is provided for all its content via the BLR website and to images via Ocellus.

      <title>The Story behind Plazi</title>

      <description>Placidus a Spescha was not only one of the first alpinists and naturalists but was also deeply committed to the ideals of the Enlightenment. He often ran afoul of his superiors who felt he neglected his priestly duties in favor of his scientific pursuits. Worse yet, he further upset the status quo through his sympathy and support of the French in the follow-up of the wars spurred by the French Revolution which brought invading French and Austrian troops into his home, Disentis, in the Vorderrhein Tal in Switzerland.</description>
