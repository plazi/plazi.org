      <description>We will demonstrate tools and infrastructure from the BiCIKL project to find and establish links between entities. These include:&#xA;Infrastructure to create and manage machine actionable persistent identifiers (PIDs) for digital specimens. This allows the creation and annotation of digital specimens as new actionable objects on the internet, which provide a surrogate for physical specimens. OpenBiodiv is a linked open data (LOD) knowledge graph extracted from the biodiversity literature. OpenBiodiv can discover hidden links, e.</description>
