      <description>Plazi will present its groundbreaking approach to the &amp;ldquo;liberation&amp;rdquo; of data from taxonomic treatments within scholarly publications at the World Biodiversity Forum.
Reliable and accessible data is essential for understanding biodiversity, its status, trends and pressures, and thus responding with informed policies and action. The FAIR data management principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable, are increasingly referenced and required by funding agencies and institutions; however, implementation remains deficient at many levels.</description>
