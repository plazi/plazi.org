      <description>The Swiss-based Plazi NGO has received a grant of EUR 1.5 million from Arcadia Fund – a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin – to further develop its Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR) established in collaboration with Zenodo, the open science repository hosted and managed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), and the open-access scholarly publisher and technology provider Pensoft.
The Arcadia-supported project helps rediscover known biodiversity by liberating taxonomic treatments, material citations and images trapped in scholarly biodiversity publications, and making them FAIR and open.</description>

      <description>At year-end, it is common to review the past year’s highlights as we (Plazi) too did, highlighting a few of the almost 9000 species discovered in 2021. A few of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading taxonomic institutions did so as well with their recent discoveries. Since we are interested in not just finding about the species discovered but also learning more in detail about them, we decided to test how easy it was to locate their original taxonomic treatments in the scientific papers that described the species mentioned in the press releases.</description>

      <guid>https://plazi.org/posts/2021/12/new-species-2021/</guid>
      <description>In 2021 Plazi provided access to the taxonomic treatments and figures of 8848 new species, 647 new genera and 27 new families discovered as part of 11391 changes in taxonomic status in 2021, published in 4420 articles from 95 journals. Here we present a small selection of 12 spectacular species with links to their complete taxonomic treatment. Since we can only protect what we know, we want people to have free access to taxonomic data, always and everywhere.</description>

      <description>On August 25, the new term request by Plazi for a new term for “a reference to or citation of one, a part of, or multiple specimens in scholarly publications” went through the public review process and resulted in the ratified term and in the Quick Reference Guide.
The original term name materialCitation has been changed to follow Darwin Core convention of using upper camel case for Class names.</description>

      <description>Three years ago we set off on a journey, guided by a philosophy that scientific data trapped in scholarly articles should be free, powered by the creativity and hardwork of a small team scattered around the globe, and supported by Arcadia Fund that decided to invest in our vision. Earlier this month we completed that journey, by all measures, a success. We liberated more data than we set out to liberate, we ended up with more partners than we started with, and we empowered more publications and publishers than three years ago.</description>

      <title>The digital age and the tragedy of not knowing what we know about biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/not-knowing-what-we-know/</link>

      <description>One of the big challenges in biology - how many species are on planet Earth, where do they live and what do they do - is increasingly relevant in the age of the biodiversity crisis. In the digital age this turns awkward, because it becomes obvious that we do not even know what we know about biodiversity. Whilst the libraries have been the undisputed source of knowledge in the analogue age, having hard copies in libraries does not serve the needs anymore.</description>

      <description>Specimens are a critical basis for taxonomic research. They are cited in taxonomic treatments and other works. Increasingly these material citations are extracted from publications and submitted as part of data sets to GBIF and reused in studies.
As of today, GBIF includes 33,393 datasets derived from taxonomic publications and 415,858 material citations which are labeled as occurrences. 335 publications reuse this data. An estimate of 45,000 species are only represented in GBIF through material citations from publications, mainly covering new species that are extracted from the literature just after the publishing time.</description>

      <description>Plazi’s goal is to discover known biodiversity, and make it widely available using the tools available in the digital age. This means liberating data hidden in libraries, and more recently, and increasingly hidden in the PDF-prison, paywalls and unstructured text.
The grand challenge is an estimated 500 Million published pages of scholarly biodiversity related publications, and 17,000 annually new discovered and described species with a multiple of annotations on already known species.</description>

      <description>Managing collaborations involving multiple locations, time zones and complementing operations is challenging. As an example, Plazi liberates data from scholarly publications by making it, in collaboration with Zenodo at CERN, findable, citable reusable for anybody, anywhere, at any time. This process happens in multiple locations in Europe, Brazil and North America. The increasingly automated processes are based on agile programming. The maintenance and improvement of high quality data requires an additional amount of time critical interactions.</description>

      <description>Three months ago we started with Pensoft an effort (see also press release) to contribute to a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) aka corona virus that led to the global COVID-19 pandemic, and in the followup joined the CETAF-Covid-19 task force. With the end of the three months long taskforce we present here our view. A multimedia presentation by the knowledge base task force sub group has been streamed on July 17.</description>

      <description>Taxonomic treatment. The taxonomic treatment is a well defined part of a publication about a particular taxon, in this case of the honey bee Apis mellifera, described by Linnaeus 1758 on page 576-577. It is based on the implicitly cited specimens in his reference collection.
A milestone in the development of modern biology was the introduction of the standardization resulting from comparative and reference works. This led to a rapidly growing corpus of knowledge by learning from, referencing of, and building on previous work, today known as the data life cycle.</description>

      <description>On the 1st of April, 2020, a new copyright law was enacted in Switzerland. Amongst other revision points, it declares an extension of the protection of photographs by applying the notion of work to non-individual photographs, provides for a new copyright exception for the use of copyrighted works for purposes of scientific research, and introduces extended collective licenses as a new instrument for collective copyright regulation. As the Plazi workflow is organised and ruled by Swiss copyright law, Plazi had to adapt to these legal amendments.</description>

      <description>Read the Eurekalert! and Knoweldge Speak release.
The COVID-19 pandemic presumably started with the escape of the Coronavirus from its bat host to humans. To understand the original host, it is important to have access to relevant scientific knowledge about these organisms. The scientific results from charting the world’s biodiversity reside in a vast corpus, which is often “imprisoned” by paywalls, copyright laws or trapped in formats unfavorable to text and data mining.</description>

      <description>A striking example of the impact of open access on the usage of scientific publications. Around 2000 antbase.org, co-funded by the Atherton-Seidal Foundation at the Smithsonian Institution provided open access to the entire ant taxonomic literature. Within a very short time, this resource has been used world wide. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1343376
Following discussions on Taxacom list server on the value on Open Science, here some points to consider.
The situation has changed regarding open access and open science.</description>

      <description>Plazi Minicurso at the Congresso Brasileiro de Zoologia, March 1, 2020
Taxonomic literature is an almost untapped resource of data covering our scholarly knowledge of biodiversity. This includes an estimated 500 Million printed pages and is augmented annually with over 17.000 taxonomic treatments of species new to science. This data represents in fact an incredibly rich citation network, albeit with most of the citations implicit, only understandable by extensive domain expertise, and often with an insurmountable time required to follow up chasing the cited resources.</description>

      <description>Am kommenden Montag (21.1.2019) berät die Kommission for Wissenschaft, Bildung und Kultur (WBK) des schweizerischen Ständerates die Revision des Urheberrechtsgesetzes. Nach dem jetzigen Revisionsentwurf sollen in Zukunft auch Fotografien, welche keinen individuellen Charakter haben, wie Werke der Kunst und der Literatur geschützt werden. Wir sind der Meinung, dass durch eine solche Bestimmung der wissenschaftlichen Lehre und Forschung, und letztlich unserer IT Industrie und Gesellschaft, erheblicher Schaden zugefügt wird, und zwar aus den folgenden Gründen:</description>

      <description>Visualization of data liberated from 22 published articles in the journals Zootaxa and PLoS ONE during the training course at Leiden University&amp;rsquo;s Integrative Taxonomy course.
The taxonomic literature is a rich, high quality, and largely untapped source of biodiversity knowledge. Taxonomy helps us recognize species and map their distributions through text descriptions, images, and records of when and where they have been observed. These are the data we need to answer questions that are relevant to our world today, like setting conservation priorities and anticipating the effects of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem functions that affect the lives of people.</description>

      <description>When Jérôme Constant published yesterday his taxonomic article on eurybrachid planthopper insects in the European Journal of Taxonomy, its data became immediately accessible as FAIR and open access data in TreatmentBank including taxonomic treatments, and the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR) as an article and figures.
This data is also at the same moment reused by GBIF to describe the dataset aka article, to list all its material citations, provide the taxonomic treatments for the included species, which is especially valuable for those new to the sciences or an individual occurrence.</description>

      <description>The Thursday November 29, 2018 (doi) issue of the Neue Zürcher Zeitung includes a “Gastkommentar” by me (Donat Agosti) arguing that the proposed insertion of an article protecting any kind of photographs of three dimensional objects in the revised copyright law of Switzerland is misguided (Art. 2 al.).
In the sciences, illustrations, including photographs, play a crucial role. They are one among many types of research data, and are used to visually document and compare results.</description>

      <description>When an &amp;lsquo;ex banker&amp;rsquo; - Tim Robertson - meets an &amp;lsquo;ex taxonomist&amp;rsquo; - Donat Agosti - this can be very inspiring, especially when they discover that they share rather unexpectedly more than they ever expected. So, what is it?
Both share data lineages. The banker has bank accounts that are created, mutated and that have at a given time a certain value. The taxonomist has species that are described, mutated and at a given time have a certain name.</description>

      <description>Zookeys at 10
Happy Birthday Zookeys, and congratulations to Pensoft, its innovator and publisher.
Today’s 10th anniversary of Zookeys is a great day for biodiversity. The discoveries reported in the press release and celebrated in the 770th issue of the journal are magnificent and open access, unlike the big bulk of taxonomic articles.
The real and unreported impact of Zookeys, its sister Biodiversity Data Journal and the many other natural history journals hosted by Pensoft is neither reported by Pensoft, widely recognized by the taxonomists nor the wider scientific community: The revolution caused, and enabled by, the technical changes adopted in the publishing of Zookeys and the subsequent journals.</description>

      <description>This is the view of Donat Agosti, cofounder of Plazi.
In 1992, I wrote an article in the followup of the Rio Earth Summit in the Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung titled “Brauchen wir zu wissen, wie viele Arten es gibt?» Now, 2018, we are still discussing this question, and I am still convinced we should. Should, because we still don’t know know the answer. But must, because of the rapidly increasing, unprecendented loss of biodiversity.</description>

The wealth of data encapsulated in scientific publications is a well-guarded secret. The recent discussions around Open Access are centered around open access to the articles, and thus little effort is made to build an index, for example, of all the illustrations therein. This is even more astounding in descriptive sciences, such as biological taxonomy, dealing with discovering and describing the world’s biological diversity, where each article includes an average of 7.</description>

      <description>Pensoft - Plazi project to produce semantically enhanced data
Open Science is based on open data. Data per se is not copyrighted and thus freely accessible. However it is kept in well maintained prisons, such as hard disks on a scientist’s desk to large password protected databases to publications that lost all their semantic structure in transition from a scientists lab to the publishers print shop. To paraphrase, scientist do all to loose structure in their data in publications.</description>
