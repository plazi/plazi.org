      <description>Placidus Spescha was not only one of the first alpinists and naturalists but was also deeply committed to the ideals of the Enlightenment. He often ran afoul of his superiors who felt he neglected his priestly duties in favor of his scientific pursuits. Worse yet, he further angered the status quo through his sympathy and support of the French in the follow-up of the wars spurred by the French Revolution which brought invasions of French and Austrian troops into his home, Disentis in the Vorderrhein Tal in Switzerland.</description>
