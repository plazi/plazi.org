      <description>Presenter: Julia Giora, Donat Agosti&#xA;We plan to share our experiment to use Plazi treament files to get new taxon names into TaxonWorks. Plazi will give us their perspective on what we did and ideas for future collaboration and what they plan to work on in the coming years. New to Plazi? See this treatment for an example of how Plazi gets data out of publications into a format we can take advantage of for uploading to our database(s) via files or the Plazi API.</description>

      <description>Plazi production on 23. December 2023 Source&#xA;1992 was a seminal point in the fight for biodiversity. The Rio Earth Summit put the loss of biodiversity on the top of the political agenda after pressure from scientists. With this the ball was back with the scientists to provide scientific evidence and the tools to measure the loss of diversity from genes to species to ecosystems. Required is a standardized report documenting change that can ultimately be used in the political dialogue, balancing the many interests covering the environment.</description>

      <description>Many of the material citations extracted by Plazi contain geo-coordinates which opens up the way to searching for them by various geographic features along with the non-geographic attributes such as taxa. It is now possible to search for images that are a part of the treatments by ecoregions, biomes and realms.&#xA;Ecoregions, biomes and realms from Olson, et. al.&#xA;The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) defines terrestrial ecoregions as follows:&#xA;Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEOW) is a biogeographic regionalization of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s terrestrial biodiversity.</description>

      <description>Presenter: Julia Giora&#xA;Since 2008, swiss-based not-for-profit organization Plazi has been supporting and promoting the development of persistent and openly accessible digital taxonomic literature. To achieve this goal, Plazi makes use of in-house softwares for data mining and extraction from taxonomic publications, along with other partner institution tools and platforms, to liberate data on animals, plants, fungi, and more. In its mission to make taxonomic data FAIRly available to the community, Plazi has developed sets of training material and courses, which enables taxonomists, collection curators, students, technicians and others to participate in the process of taxonomic data liberation.</description>

      <description>Presenter: Donat Agosti&#xA;Scholarly publications are the channel to communicate research findings based on the analysis of specimens and their traits. In an open science world, the link to the specimens together with the description of the methods involved should enable us to reproduce the results. Increasingly, taxonomic publications provide a section with structured or even semantically enhanced tables, including persistent digital identifiers of the specimens. These publications can be processed, reformatted as datasets of material citations that can be reused, for example by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).</description>

      <description>The scientific knowledge on biodiversity is imprisoned in a daily growing corpus of hundred millions of pages of scientific publications. This knowledge is needed to better understand the dynamics and dimensions of the global biodiversity crisis, to understand the impact of climate change on the distribution of species or to understand the viral spillover from animals to humans. This knowledge is very difficult to access because it is unstructured, in printed formats, including portable data format (PDF), which are difficult to machine operate, or closed access.</description>

      <title>The new value of scientific publications in the digital age</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/2023/05/new-value-of-scientific-pubs/</link>

      <description>Scientific publications are the means by which scientific knowledge is communicated. In botany as well as all biological sciences, each new species discovered is based on at least one publication including a protologue conformant to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. A protologue is based on a standard vocabulary, including a material citation of the type specimen and its hosting institution, generally a figure with the diagnostic characters and a discussion of related species.</description>

      <description>A goal of natural history institutions is contributing to the understanding of biodiversity and disseminating this knowledge by becoming scientific publishers. Through this, they joined the growing field of scholarly publishing established in 1665 by the Journal des s√ßavans to publish work from the sciences. One of the characteristics of scientific publishing is to cite previous works and thus linking existing knowledge with new discoveries. To provide access to the growing corpus of publications, libraries began to index individual works.</description>

      <description>eBioDiv is a Swissuniversities funded project by a consortium of HES-SO/SIB (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), Plazi, and the Natural History Museum of Bern (NMBE) with the goal to build a knowledge infrastructure to bring data in taxonomic literature together with physical specimens digitalized through projects funded by SwissCollNet. The linking is based on that fact that specimen, the basis of taxonomic works, are cited formally in the publications as material citations.</description>

      <description>Discovery of species is based on specimens and communicated through taxonomic treatments described in and presented as parts of scientific publications. In an ideal world, this would allow us to ask questions such as ‚Äúwhat is known about this specimen?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat does a gene sequence of a cited physical specimen look like?‚Äù, and the results would appear immediately on our computer screens in a format suitable for further analysis.</description>

      <description>We report progress towards automatically transforming existing analyses of scientific literature into annotations based on W3C&amp;rsquo;s Web Annotation Data Model (WADM). Case studies are presented from the life sciences, and social sciences and humanities, in which these developments have led to the creation of new unrestricted data services for the research community. We discuss the cross- domain potential of annotation infrastructure for releasing scientific facts reported in research literature from copyright restrictions, and demonstrate the utility of common standards-based preservation and discovery methods in disparate activities.</description>

      <description>Three years ago we set off on a journey, guided by a philosophy that scientific data trapped in scholarly articles should be free, powered by the creativity and hardwork of a small team scattered around the globe, and supported by Arcadia that decided to invest in our vision. Earlier this month we completed that journey, by all measures, a success. We liberated more data than we set out to liberate, we ended up with more partners than we started with, and we empowered more publications and publishers than three years ago.</description>

      <title>The digital age and the tragedy of not knowing what we know about biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://plazi.org/posts/not-knowing-what-we-know/</link>

      <description>One of the big challenges in biology - how many species are on planet Earth, where do they live and what do they do - is increasingly relevant in the age of the biodiversity crisis. In the digital age this turns awkward, because it becomes obvious that we do not even know what we know about biodiversity. Whilst the libraries have been the undisputed source of knowledge in the analogue age, having hard copies in libraries does not serve the needs anymore.</description>

      <description>Specimens are a critical basis for taxonomic research. They are cited in taxonomic treatments and other works. Increasingly these material citations are extracted from publications and submitted as part of data sets to GBIF and reused in studies.&#xA;As of today, GBIF includes 33,393 datasets derived from taxonomic publications and 415,858 material citations which are labeled as occurrences. 335 publications reuse this data. An estimate of 45,000 species are only represented in GBIF through material citations from publications, mainly covering new species that are extracted from the literature just after the publishing time.</description>

      <description>Plazi‚Äôs goal is to discover known biodiversity, and make it widely available using the tools available in the digital age. This means liberating data hidden in libraries, and more recently, and increasingly hidden in the PDF-prison, paywalls and unstructured text.&#xA;The grand challenge is an estimated 500 Million published pages of scholarly biodiversity related publications, and 17,000 annually new discovered and described species with a multiple of annotations on already known species.</description>

      <description>Managing collaborations involving multiple locations, time zones and complementing operations is challenging. As an example, Plazi liberates data from scholarly publications by making it, in collaboration with Zenodo at CERN, findable, citable reusable for anybody, anywhere, at any time. This process happens in multiple locations in Europe, Brazil and North America. The increasingly automated processes are based on agile programming. The maintenance and improvement of high quality data requires an additional amount of time critical interactions.</description>

      <description>Taxonomic treatment. The taxonomic treatment is a well defined part of a publication about a particular taxon, in this case of the honey bee Apis mellifera, described by Linnaeus 1758 on page 576-577. It is based on the implicitly cited specimens in his reference collection.&#xA;A milestone in the development of modern biology was the introduction of the standardization resulting from comparative and reference works. This led to a rapidly growing corpus of knowledge by learning from, referencing of, and building on previous work, today known as the data life cycle.</description>

      <description>On the 1st of April, 2020, a new copyright law was enacted in Switzerland. Amongst other revision points, it declares an extension of the protection of photographs by applying the notion of work to non-individual photographs, provides for a new copyright exception for the use of copyrighted works for purposes of scientific research, and introduces extended collective licenses as a new instrument for collective copyright regulation. As the Plazi workflow is organised and ruled by Swiss copyright law, Plazi had to adapt to these legal amendments.</description>

This includes an estimated 500 Million printed pages and is augmented annually with over 17.000 taxonomic treatments of species new to science. This data represents in fact an incredibly rich citation network, albeit with most of the citations implicit, only understandable by extensive domain expertise, and often with an insurmountable time required to follow up chasing the cited resources.</description>

      <description>The Swiss Parliament adopted a new copyright law on 27 September, 2019. Amongst its many new elements, there is a large exception to copyright for the use of protected works for scientific research purposes (Art. 24d1). This exception is compulsory and overrules any subsequent license agreements. It allows copying and reuse of copyrighted works for commercial or non-commercial scientific research, and refers to any work to which the researcher has lawful access.</description>

      <description>Am kommenden Montag (21.1.2019) ber√§t die Kommission for Wissenschaft, Bildung und Kultur (WBK) des schweizerischen St√§nderates die Revision des Urheberrechtsgesetzes. Nach dem jetzigen Revisionsentwurf sollen in Zukunft auch Fotografien, welche keinen individuellen Charakter haben, wie Werke der Kunst und der Literatur gesch√ºtzt werden. Wir sind der Meinung, dass durch eine solche Bestimmung der wissenschaftlichen Lehre und Forschung, und letztlich unserer IT Industrie und Gesellschaft, erheblicher Schaden zugef√ºgt wird, und zwar aus den folgenden Gr√ºnden:</description>

      <description>Visualization of data liberated from 22 published articles in the journals Zootaxa and PLoS ONE during the training course at Leiden University&amp;rsquo;s Integrative Taxonomy course.&#xA;The taxonomic literature is a rich, high quality, and largely untapped source of biodiversity knowledge. Taxonomy helps us recognize species and map their distributions through text descriptions, images, and records of when and where they have been observed. These are the data we need to answer questions that are relevant to our world today, like setting conservation priorities and anticipating the effects of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem functions that affect the lives of people.</description>

      <description>When J√©r√¥me Constant published yesterday his taxonomic article on eurybrachid planthopper insects in the European Journal of Taxonomy, its data became immediately accessible as FAIR and open access data in TreatmentBank including taxonomic treatments, and the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR) as an article and figures.&#xA;This data is also at the same moment reused by GBIF to describe the dataset aka article, to list all its material citations, provide the taxonomic treatments for the included species, which is especially valuable for those new to the sciences or an individual occurrence.</description>

      <description>The Thursday November 29, 2018 (doi) issue of the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung includes a ‚ÄúGastkommentar‚Äù by me (Donat Agosti) arguing that the proposed insertion of an article protecting any kind of photographs of three dimensional objects in the revised copyright law of Switzerland is misguided (Art. 2 al.).&#xA;In the sciences, illustrations, including photographs, play a crucial role. They are one among many types of research data, and are used to visually document and compare results.</description>

      <description>When an &amp;rsquo;ex banker&amp;rsquo; - Tim Robertson - meets an &amp;rsquo;ex taxonomist&amp;rsquo; - Donat Agosti - this can be very inspiring, especially when they discover that they share rather unexpectedly more than they ever expected. So, what is it?&#xA;Both share data lineages. The banker has bank accounts that are created, mutated and that have at a given time a certain value. The taxonomist has species that are described, mutated and at a given time have a certain name.</description>

      <description>Zookeys at 10&#xA;Happy Birthday Zookeys, and congratulations to Pensoft, its innovator and publisher.&#xA;Today‚Äôs 10th anniversary of Zookeys is a great day for biodiversity. The discoveries reported in the press release and celebrated in the 770th issue of the journal are magnificent and open access, unlike the big bulk of taxonomic articles.&#xA;The real and unreported impact of Zookeys, its sister Biodiversity Data Journal and the many other natural history journals hosted by Pensoft is neither reported by Pensoft, widely recognized by the taxonomists nor the wider scientific community: The revolution caused, and enabled by, the technical changes adopted in the publishing of Zookeys and the subsequent journals.</description>

      <description>Visual search results from the Biodiversity Literature Repository. Each of the images provides access to the taxonomic treatment of the species or the source article. Only figures from scholarly publications are provided.&#xA;Plazi has received a grant of EUR 1.1 million from Arcadia ‚Äì the charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin ‚Äì to liberate data, such as taxonomic treatments and images, trapped in scholarly biodiversity publications.&#xA;The project will expand the existing corpus of the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR), a joint venture of Plazi and Pensoft, hosted on Zenodo at CERN.</description>

      <description>This is the view of Donat Agosti, cofounder of Plazi.&#xA;In 1992, I wrote an article in the followup of the Rio Earth Summit in the Swiss newspaper Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung titled ‚ÄúBrauchen wir zu wissen, wie viele Arten es gibt?¬ª Now, 2018, we are still discussing this question, and I am still convinced we should. Should, because we still don‚Äôt know know the answer. But must, because of the rapidly increasing, unprecendented loss of biodiversity.</description>

      <description>Ocellus: Search term &amp;ldquo;Perlidae&amp;rdquo;. All the images are provided with a link to the source.&#xA;The wealth of data encapsulated in scientific publications is a well-guarded secret. The recent discussions around Open Access are centered around open access to the articles, and thus little effort is made to build an index, for example, of all the illustrations therein. This is even more astounding in descriptive sciences, such as biological taxonomy, dealing with discovering and describing the world‚Äôs biological diversity, where each article includes an average of 7.</description>

      <description>Pensoft - Plazi project to produce semantically enhanced data&#xA;Open Science is based on open data. Data per se is not copyrighted and thus freely accessible. However it is kept in well maintained prisons, such as hard disks on a scientist‚Äôs desk to large password protected databases to publications that lost all their semantic structure in transition from a scientists lab to the publishers print shop. To paraphrase, scientist do all to loose structure in their data in publications.</description>
