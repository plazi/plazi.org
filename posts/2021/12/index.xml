      <description>Plazi provided access to the taxonomic treatments and figures of 8848 new species in 2021. These species comprised 647 new genera and 27 new families discovered in 2021, were published in 4420 articles taken from 95 journals. Here we present a small selection of 12 spectacular species with links to their complete taxonomic treatment. Since we can only protect what we know, we want people to have free access to taxonomic data, always and everywhere.</description>
