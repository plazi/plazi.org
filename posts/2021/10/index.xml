      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our colleague Prof. Roderick Page recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://iphylo.blogspot.com/2021/10/problems-with-plazi-parsing-how.html&#34;&gt;wrote about quality issues&lt;/a&gt; with the data we are extracting from scientific literature and making available for anyone to use anywhere for any purpose. We are thankful for Rod&amp;rsquo;s insightful and helpful criticism. In this post (and several others to come), we explain material citations and other data that we extract, address the data quality issues — why they exist, what we are doing about them — and why the extracted data are still important and useful despite the inherent errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
