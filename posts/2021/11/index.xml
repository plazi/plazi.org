      <description>Figure 1: A snapshot of a published table showing the GenBank accession numbers and localities for the 507 individuals representing 61 species of Cladocera and 19 of Copepoda used in this study. DOI: https://doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.1839.1.1     Figure 2: The same table as in Figure 1 extracted by TreatmentBank. Full table available in HTML and JSON formats.    Linking molecular data to taxonomic names and their extensive taxonomic treatments represents a fundamental component in biodiversity assessment.</description>

      <description>e-BioDiv: processing data liberation  At today’s meeting of the Swiss Systematics Society, the species of the year — a species discovered and described by a Swiss scientist — will be selected.
Currently 89 species have been listed out of 31 publications, of which 69% are open access and 31% closed access, and the Revue Suisse de Zoologie is the most prolific journal. New species are hardly ever the only taxonomic treatment of a publication.</description>

      <description>Plazi will participate in the Biohackthon Europe. Each November ELIXIR organizes BioHackathon Europe, which brings together bioinformaticians from around the world. The event takes place in different locations around Europe. The BioHackathon offers an intense week of hacking, with over 160 international participants who work on diverse and exciting projects. The week starts with a half-day symposium to introduce these projects, and is followed by five days of hacking with one sole aim: coding to address problems in bioinformatics.</description>
