      <description>At year-end, it is common to review the past yearâ€™s highlights as we (Plazi) too did, highlighting a few of the almost 9000 species discovered in 2021. A few of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading taxonomic institutions did so as well with their recent discoveries. Since we are interested in not just finding about the species discovered but also learning more in detail about them, we decided to test how easy it was to locate their original taxonomic treatments in the scientific papers that described the species mentioned in the press releases.</description>
