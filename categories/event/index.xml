      <description>October 14-15, 2021: Southern African Society for Systematic Biology Webinar and workshop (Re)discovering known biodiversity imprisoned in scientific publications
Scholarly knowledge about biodiversity is documented in hundreds of millions of pages of scientific literature. This includes original descriptions of all species on earth, and the chain of taxonomic treatments that might follow them, linked by citation. These treatments include statements about species distribution, behavior, life forms, ecology, conservation status, and changes to species limits through splitting or synonymy.</description>

      <description>October 21, 2021: Beijing, China Plazi together with Data Futures, MNHN France, SIB Switzerland and CERN Switzerland will present the lecture &amp;ldquo;Progress with improving preservation and reuse of scientific research data.
Abstract: We report progress towards automatically transforming existing analyses of scientific literature into annotations based on W3C&amp;rsquo;s Web Annotation Data Model (WADM). Case studies are presented from the life sciences, and social sciences and humanities, in which these developments have led to the creation of new unrestricted data services for the research community.</description>
